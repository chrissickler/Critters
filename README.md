# Critters

For Sunday
00. Make all Critters extend TestCritter and do method tests - Karl
0. General Stats Method - Chris
	-UMM I dont think there is anything to do unless we want 		to output more stats or want to override this in each 		critter class
1. Implement all Critters (fight, runStats, etc. if not yet done) - C&K
	-Finished Critters 1 and 2
	-From what I can tell, I don't think we need to override 		the Critter.runStats
	-Needs testing
2. Main flags - Chris
	-Need to fix stats still 
	-seed is taking input only from input string array
3. Exceptions & Errors - Chris
	-Needs implementing
4. Comment Everything - C&K
	-Chris needs this
5. System Tests - Karl
6. We cannot hard code search through a list of known critters. Its in the FAQ for assignment4. So these probably need some editting:
	-M.stats
	(I realize I did all this LOL - Chris)

From Piazza
-When we call the handle interactions method, we need to check to see if both try to move, and they move to the same spot, then they fight again? or do we just let one move there and the other not move at all?

DONE
